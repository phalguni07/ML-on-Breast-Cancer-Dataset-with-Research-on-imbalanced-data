# ML-on-Breast-Cancer-Dataset-with-Research-on-imbalanced-data

In this project we are building end-to-end machine learning model on breast cancer dataset(available in the repo) to
classify each data point into malignant or benign based on features given. <br>
We are starting by preprocessing the data using techniques like outlier detection (box plots), looking for missing values, checking categorical data,
scaling and handling imbalance. Then we are applying variety of classification algorithms and comparing them
to select top 3 algorithms. We will be tuning the hyperparameters of top algorithms and calculating the score.
Further, we have chosen, handling imbalance data as our research area to understand alternative ways to deal
with it like Smote techniques - KMeans Smotes, Borderline Smote, etc
<br>
The report for the project is written in the form of research paper to understand the flow of research in 
ML and for ease of reading to reader.
